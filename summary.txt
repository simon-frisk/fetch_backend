1. Why did you choose the tools, libraries, and language you used for the coding exercise?

I really like the Express.js framework for building REST APIs. I think it is simple, clear and
fast to work with.

2. What are the advantages and disadvantages of your solution?

My solution stores data in memory which clearly would not work for a real solution. Then we would
need a database. I also would prefer working with a strongly typed language like TypeScript in a
larger project, as not having types for data models can make things unmanageble after a while. For a
smaller and quicker project like this, not having strong typing increases my development speed.

3. What has been a favorite school/personal project thus far? What about it that challenged you?

My favorite project was Bookii, which was a mobile app I developed with a Node.js backend similar to
this, and a React Native frontend. I had so much fun working on this and learned a lot. Bookii was
an app where readers could keep track of and find books to read. The backend development was a lot of
fun but also challanging, because I both had to have an API towards the frontend, but also had to 
download data about books, like descriptions, genres and pictures, and data like the new york times
bestseller lists. Because my storage space was very limited, I had to do this in a smart way, to not
download data about books that were not in use in the app (there are a lot of books that are not
likely to be browsed in the app). Solving these questions was definitely a challange but also a lot
of fun, and the project really taught me how fun backend development can be.
